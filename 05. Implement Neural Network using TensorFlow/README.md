## What is TensorFlow?

- TensorFlow is a open source software framework for building and training machine learning models
- TensorFlow is named after the mathematical concept of tensors (multi-dimensional arrays)
- Popular for deep learning tasks
- TensorFlow allows us to build models using high-level APIs (like Keras) or directly manipulate tensors for low-level control
- **Scalability:** can be used on various platforms, from smartphones to clusters of servers
- **Eco-system:** part of a ML ecosystem that includes tools like <ins>TensorBoard for visualization</ins> and <ins>TensorFlow Serving for deploying models</ins>
- Supports a wide range of hardware accelerators, including GPUs and TPUs (Tensor Processing Units)
- TensorFlow can be integrated with other popular libraries and frameworks in the machine learning and data science space
- Many companies and researchers use TensorFlow for their machine learning and deep learning projects

## Steps to follow when implementing NN using TensorFlow

1. Implement model (implement the architecture)
2. Compile model
3. Train model
4. Evaluate model
5. Make predictions
